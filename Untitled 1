What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?
Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable more than one user at a time without 
requiring multiple copies of the program running on the computer.
Multithreading allows the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These parts are known as threads 
and are lightweight processes available within the process.So multithreading leads to maximum utilization of the 
CPU by multitasking.
